# AWS Notes

Author: Lucas Pichette

## Project Description

Free, highly available, always-up-to-date, comprehensive yet to-the-point, and extremely easy to use AWS notes.

## Problems to Solve

1. *Extremely* cost efficient
1. Storage
1. Easy to create and modify notes
1. Worldwide accessibility
  1. Start with U.S. accessibility
1. Very quick (and -- moreso -- relevant) searching

### *Extremely* Cost Efficient

To aid in my own learning of AWS Services "under-the-hood" and to help drive down costs, I will be creating my own file servers, Lambda VMs, and more!

The latter was a difficult decision to make, as it's not "using AWS resources". So, I've decided that the latter version will be the public version, and that I would create an alternative "personal-use" version.

The "personal use" version will be IaC that users can use to provision this same project but on AWS resources to make their own AWS notes! >:)

While all of this really hits the *Extremely* Cost Efficient requirement, it's honestly mostly done for my own learning as well -- even if it makes this project a bit harder to complete.
